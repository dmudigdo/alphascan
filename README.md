# Alpha scanner

Just playing around with JavaScript at the moment.

Eventually I would like to make an automated [partner assisted scanning](https://www.scopeaust.org.au/talk-person-uses-partner-assisted-scanning/) web page written in JavaScript. I am assuming the subject can click a mouse, but nothing else (e.g. stroke victim).

I envision a 5 x 5 grid of the alphabet (without 'Z'), the rows will 'light up' at two second intervals, at which time the subject can select a row with mouse click (a mouse click anywhere, not necessarily on the row). Then, having selected a row, the columns of that row will 'light up' at 2 second intervals, at which time the subject can select a column. Having therefore selected an alphabet letter, that letter is typed out, then the subject selects the next letter, using the same method.
